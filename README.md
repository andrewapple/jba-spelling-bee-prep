#   🧙‍♂️🐝 JBA's Spelling Bee Practice

My daughter has advanced in her school spelling bee three years in a row. (Go Juju!) 

I build a new web app each year to help her practice, and I always add one or two new features.

## How It Works

The app is the epitome of user friendly. However, I love explaining things. Humor me.

1. Click "view the app" below
2. Once the page loads, choose "In Order" or "Random"
> 💡 **IN ORDER** - The words will appear in he order they're listed on the official Spelling Bee Word List. They go from **easy** to **hard**.
> 
> 💡 **RANDOM** - The words will be in random order.
3. The application will filter through all the words without repeating until each word has been shown at least once.
4. Once order is chosen, click "Start Practice"
5. Read the word to the student.
6. The student must SAY - SPELL - SAY
7. If they spell the word correctly, click "Next"
8. If they spell the word incorrectly, show them the correct way to spell it. Then click "Recycle".
> 💡 **RECYCLE** - When you "Recycle" a word, the app will show that word again after 10 to 20 words.
